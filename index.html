        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat">Cat wikipedia</a>

        <p>There are hundreds of types of cat breeds and they are all interesting in their own way</p>

        <h3>Here are some of my favorite breeds</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>American shorthair</li>

            <li>Flame point Saiamise</li>

            <li>Bombay</li>
        </ul>

        <p>I love all cats because I think they are very cute.</p>


        <h3>Another one of my favorite thins are butterfly knifes</h3>

        <a href="https://www.bladehq.com/cat--Butterfly-Knives--70">Butterfly knive</a>

        <p>The butterfly knife is a type of folding pocketknife that originated in the Philippines. Its distinct features are two handles counter-rotating around the tang such that, when closed, the blade is concealed within grooves in the handles</p>

        <p>I love to practice and learn new tricks with a butterfly knife, it is very fun, calming, and it looks really cool</p>
